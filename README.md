# Wine Properties Assessment

This project focuses on analyzing various properties of red wine and white wine. Analysis consists of cleaning, hypothesis testing and visualization through tables and dynamic grids. The aim is to find information about wine characteristics and provide a detailed comparative analysis between red and white wines.

## Project structure

This repository has the following main components:

- **Importing and Cleaning Data**: This sheet details the data preparation process, including cleaning and preprocessing steps for the wine data.
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Statistical tests are performed on the wine properties to validate specific hypotheses about the differences and relationships between red and white wines.
- **Dashboard**: A visual representation of the wine data, providing an easy-to-understand summary of key metrics.
- **Red Wine Pivots**: Pivot tables analyzing the characteristics and properties specific to red wines.
- **White Wine Pivots**: Similar to the red wine analysis, this sheet provides pivot tables for white wine properties.
- **Comparative Pivots**: A comparative analysis between red and white wine properties using pivot tables.
